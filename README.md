# Budgetopolis 🏙️  
**Your wallet builds your world.**

Budgetopolis turns your spending habits into a living city. Save smart, and your streets thrive. Overspend, and your town drowns in fast food joints and debt collectors.

---

## 📖 Overview
Budgetopolis gamifies financial awareness through a visual metaphor: your spending literally shapes your city. Each spending category builds structures — groceries spawn markets, entertainment adds cinemas, hygiene cleans graffiti, and rent keeps your “home” unlocked.

## 💡 Concept
Most finance tools guilt-trip users. Budgetopolis shows, not tells. You don’t see a pie chart — you see your city becoming what you buy. Every check-in reflects real choices, making money management tangible.

---

## 🏗️ Core Features
- **Category-driven building:** Fast food = more restaurants, savings = parks, rent = housing stability.  
- **Dynamic city state:** Overspending creates decay, neglect adds graffiti, balance restores order.  
- **Personal room:** A customizable apartment tied to your habits — miss rent, lose access.  
- **Daily check-ins:** Quick “spending reflection” to update your city’s state.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User logs daily or weekly spending categories manually (demo) or via mock data.  
2. The app converts spending ratios into city-building events.  
3. The frontend animates changes — new buildings, cleaned walls, or urban decay
